ðŸŽ‰ ScrollView vs FlatList
Use FlatList when:
Performance is critical: FlatList only renders items currently visible on screen, saving memory and improving performance.
Long lists of data: When rendering potentially large sets of data (feeds, search results, message lists).
Unknown content length: When you don't know in advance how many items you'll need to display.
Same kind of content: When displaying many items with the same structure.

âœ… Use ScrollView when:
All content fits in memory: When you're displaying a small, fixed amount of content that won't cause performance issues.
Static content: For screens with predetermined, limited content like forms, profile pages, or detail views.
Mixed content types: When you need to display different UI components in a specific layout that doesn't follow a list pattern.
Horizontal carousel-like elements: Small horizontal scrolling components like image carousels with limited items.

ðŸš€ Pressable vs TouchableOpacity

## Use Pressable when:

More customization is needed: Pressable offers more customization options for different states (pressed, hovered, focused).
Complex interaction states: When you need to handle multiple interaction states with fine-grained control.
Future-proofing: Pressable is newer and designed to eventually replace the Touchable components.
Platform-specific behavior: When you want to customize behavior across different platforms.
Nested press handlers: When you need to handle nested interactive elements.
